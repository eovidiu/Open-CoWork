# Disable automatic lifecycle script execution (postinstall, preinstall, etc.)
# This prevents arbitrary code execution from dependencies during install.
# Packages that require lifecycle scripts (like electron-builder, better-sqlite3, playwright)
# must be handled explicitly via pnpm/npm run commands.
# In CI: use --ignore-scripts during pnpm install, then explicitly run required steps.
# Locally: use `pnpm install` followed by `pnpm run postinstall` if needed for dev.
