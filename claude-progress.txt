# Progress Log

Read this file at the START of every session to understand project state.

## Session 1: Initialization
Date: 2026-02-14
Agent: Initializer
Status: Environment setup complete

### Created:
- .harness.json: Project configuration (1 node stack, pnpm)
- init.sh: Session initialization script (pnpm, vitest, prisma generate)
- features.json: 26 security remediation features identified, all pending
  - P0 (F001-F007): 7 critical, must fix before any distribution
  - P1 (F008-F017): 10 high, must fix before public release
  - P2 (F018-F026): 9 medium-term hardening items
- claude-progress.txt: This file
- context_summary.md: Preserved from prior security analysis (not overwritten)

### Context:
- Full 6-dimension security analysis completed (253 checks, 42 unique FAILs)
- 13 issues from 2026-02-11 baseline resolved via fix/* branches
- 8 new findings from expanded coverage
- Consolidated report: analysis/general-security-analysis-2026-02-14.md

### Verification Protocol:
- Before finalizing any subagent work, run general-security-analyzer skill on affected dimensions
- This ensures no regressions are introduced during remediation

### Ready for:
- First coding agent to begin work on F001: Remove interpreters from bash allowlist

## Session 2: F001, F006, F012
Date: 2026-02-14
Agent: Orchestrator + 3 parallel coding agents + 1 security verification agent

### Worked On:
- F001: Remove interpreters from bash allowlist (P0)
- F006: Add rehype-sanitize to ReactMarkdown (P0)
- F012: Fix fs:exists to use validatePath (P1)

### Completed:
- F001: Removed 13 dangerous executables (sh/bash/zsh/python/python3/node/npx/env/curl/wget/awk/pip/pip3). Added argument-level validation for find (-exec), sed (/e), git (-c), npm (exec), pnpm (exec/dlx). 142 shell tests pass.
- F006: Installed rehype-sanitize v6.0.0, wired into ChatArea.tsx. Verified no other ReactMarkdown instances or dangerouslySetInnerHTML exist.
- F012: Added validatePath to fs:exists, fs:glob CWD, and fs:bash CWD. Uses validated return path. Returns false (no info leak) for sensitive paths.
- Fixed 8 pre-existing test environment bugs (macOS /var symlink, BSD echo -n, /workspace/ paths)

### Security Verification:
- Ran security-auditor agent post-implementation
- F006: VERIFIED — no issues
- F012: Fixed minor bug (access used original path, not validated path). Added CWD validation to glob/bash.
- F001: Identified and mitigated additional bypass vectors (awk system(), find -exec, git -c, npm exec, pnpm exec, sed /e). Removed awk/pip/pip3 from allowlist.

### Known Remaining Bypass Vectors (F001):
- npm/pnpm: Can still do `npm install malicious-package` (lifecycle scripts)
- git: Other attack vectors beyond -c (hooks, custom pagers via env)
- These require deeper architectural changes (sandboxed execution environment)

### Git Commits:
- aedafee: fix: resolve pre-existing test failures on macOS
- e705f05: security: implement F001, F006, F012
- 9dbb026: security: harden F001 and F012 based on security verification

### For Next Agent:
- Next P0 features to tackle: F005 (remove getApiKey from preload), F004 (wire PermissionService), F002 (HITL gates)
- F002 is the most complex — needs an approval UI component in the renderer
- F003 (Electron Fuses) and F007 (code signing) need build infrastructure and certificates
- 618 tests currently passing across 19 files

---

## Session 3: F004, F005
Date: 2026-02-14
Agent: Orchestrator + 2 parallel coding agents + 1 security verification agent

### Worked On:
- F004: Wire PermissionService into IPC handlers (P0)
- F005: Remove getApiKey from preload (P0)

### Completed:
- F004: Shared getPermissionService() singleton in database.ts. Permission checks added to fs:readFile, fs:readFileBase64, fs:writeFile, fs:readDirectory, fs:glob, fs:grep, fs:bash, browser:navigate, browser:openForLogin. permissions.ipc.ts uses shared instance. 14 new enforcement integration tests.
- F005: Removed settings:getApiKey handler entirely. Added webRequest interceptor to inject Authorization header at network level for openrouter.ai. Renderer uses hasApiKey (boolean) and getApiKeyMasked. All 14 renderer files updated. Exported createElectronSecureStorage.

### Security Verification:
- Ran security verification agent post-implementation
- F005 VERIFIED: API key unreachable from renderer, webRequest correctly scoped, raw ipcRenderer removed
- F004 VERIFIED: Permission checks correctly placed on 4 original handlers
- CRITICAL finding: fs:readFileBase64 had NO permission check (bypass of fs:readFile) -> Fixed
- HIGH findings: fs:readDirectory, fs:glob, fs:grep, browser:openForLogin had no permission checks -> Fixed
- HIGH finding: webRequest interceptor recreated settingsService per request -> Fixed (cached)
- LOW: Type declarations still declare unused window.electron, fs:exists leaks existence info

### Git Commits:
- 239754f: security: implement F004 and F005

### For Next Agent:
- Next P0 features: F002 (HITL gates), F003 (Electron Fuses), F007 (code signing)
- F002 is the most complex — needs an approval UI component in the renderer
- F003 and F007 need build infrastructure and certificates from Ovidiu
- 633 tests currently passing across 20 test files
- 5 of 7 P0 items done (F001, F004, F005, F006, F012)

## Session 4: F002
Date: 2026-02-14
Agent: Orchestrator + 1 coding agent + 1 security verification agent

### Worked On:
- F002: Wire HITL approval gates for dangerous/moderate tools (P0)

### Completed:
- F002: Created approvalStore (Zustand, blocking Promise pattern), ToolApprovalDialog (countdown timer, approve/deny/allow-all), executeWithApproval wrapper for 7 tools. Session allowances cleared on conversation switch.

### Security Hardening (post-verification):
- Finding 1 (HIGH): Removed phantom `writeFile` from MODERATE_TOOLS (no such tool exists)
- Finding 3 (HIGH): Auto-deny overwritten pending approval (prevents Promise hang)
- Finding 4 (MEDIUM): Wired clearSession() call in uiStore.setActiveConversation
- Finding 5 (MEDIUM): Moved resolve functions to private Map (not exposed on Zustand state)
- Out-of-scope: Finding 2 (IPC bypass — architectural, renderer-only gate is expected for now)

### Git Commits:
- ce77df2: security: implement F002 — HITL approval gates for dangerous/moderate tools

### For Next Agent:
- Remaining P0 features: F003 (Electron Fuses), F007 (code signing)
- F003 needs @electron/fuses devDependency and postbuild script
- F007 needs certificates from Ovidiu
- 648 tests currently passing across 21 test files
- 6 of 7 P0 items done (F001, F002, F004, F005, F006, F012)
