## Session 1: Initialization
Date: 2026-02-14
Agent: Initializer
Status: Environment setup complete

### Created:
- .harness.json: Project configuration (1 node stack, pnpm)
- init.sh: Session initialization script (pnpm, vitest, prisma generate)
- features.json: 26 security remediation features identified, all pending
  - P0 (F001-F007): 7 critical, must fix before any distribution
  - P1 (F008-F017): 10 high, must fix before public release
  - P2 (F018-F026): 9 medium-term hardening items
- claude-progress.txt: This file
- context_summary.md: Preserved from prior security analysis (not overwritten)

### Context:
- Full 6-dimension security analysis completed (253 checks, 42 unique FAILs)
- 13 issues from 2026-02-11 baseline resolved via fix/* branches
- 8 new findings from expanded coverage
- Consolidated report: analysis/general-security-analysis-2026-02-14.md

### Verification Protocol:
- Before finalizing any subagent work, run general-security-analyzer skill on affected dimensions
- This ensures no regressions are introduced during remediation

### Ready for:
- First coding agent to begin work on F001: Remove interpreters from bash allowlist
